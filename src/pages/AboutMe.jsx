                With Technology :
              </h4>
              <p>
                My passion for technology began in my childhood, around 2008. I
                was fascinated by computers and spent many hours playing video
                games and browsing the internet. I enjoyed watching videos on
                YouTube and talking to friends on social media platforms like
                Facebook and Twitter. At the time, it felt like fun‚Äîbut in
                reality, it started a deep interest in how technology works. By
                the time I reached high school, I knew I wanted to study
                something related to computers.

                Unversity & High School :
              </h4>
              <p>
                In 2017, I took a big step and joined the University of Gezira,
                in the Faculty of Engineering and Technology, where I studied
                Computer Engineering. I started learning programming in high
                school, when we were taught the basics of Pascal and binary
                number systems. Then in 2018, I wrote my first real lines of
                code using C++. Seeing the result of something I created was a
                powerful and exciting experience‚Äîit confirmed that this is what
                I wanted to do.

                Falling in love with UI & Linux :
              </h4>
              <p>
                In 2021, I discovered my real passion: building user interfaces.
                I realized I enjoy creating things people can actually see and
                use‚Äîdesigning layouts, building clean components, and making
                smooth user experiences. That same year, I made another
                important decision: I switched from using Windows to Linux as my
                main system, after a friend recommended it. Using Linux made me
                feel more focused and comfortable while coding. Today, I‚Äôm still
                learning and growing as a frontend developer‚Äîalways driven by
                the same curiosity that started when I was a child.
